# Enhanced Plan for Dreamdeck Application

## Overview

This plan integrates the latest LangGraph and Chainlit features while addressing current codebase needs. The focus is on leveraging the Functional API, improving data persistence, and enhancing user interaction.

---

## 1. **Finalize LangGraph Functional API Integration**

### Status: Completed
- All core workflows now use LangGraph's Functional API with proper decorators
- Checkpointing and streaming are fully implemented
- Human-in-the-loop review steps are functional

---

## 2. **Enhance Data Persistence Layer**

### Status: In Progress
- User session persistence implemented
- Thread-specific data storage in progress
- Feedback collection and analysis pending

---

## 3. **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling**

### Status: Completed
- Added retry logic for image generation
- Enhanced error handling for API calls
- Better logging for all exceptions

---

## 4. **Improve Configuration Management**

### Status: Not Started
- Configuration validation needs implementation
- Default values need to be added

---

## 5. **Add Documentation and Testing**

### Status: Not Started
- Docstrings need to be added
- Unit and integration tests need to be written
- User and developer guides need to be created

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Enhance Data Persistence**
   - Complete thread-specific data storage
   - Implement feedback collection

2. **Improve Configuration Management**
   - Add validation for critical settings
   - Implement default values

3. **Add Documentation and Testing**
   - Add comprehensive docstrings
   - Implement unit and integration tests

4. **Finalize User Session Management**
   - Add session expiration
   - Implement session cleanup

5. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add metrics collection
   - Implement log rotation

---

## Conclusion

The application now has a robust foundation with proper error handling and LangGraph integration. The next steps should focus on completing the data persistence layer and adding comprehensive documentation.
