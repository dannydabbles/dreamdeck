## Knowledge Base

- Place `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files inside the `./knowledge` directory.
- On startup or chat resume, these files are **automatically loaded**, chunked, and indexed into the vector store.
- The knowledge base is used for **retrieval-augmented generation** to enrich the story.

---

## Configuration

- The app is configured via `config.yaml`.
- You can override any config value with environment variables prefixed by `APP_`.
- Key sections:
  - `llm`: Base LLM parameters.
  - `agents`: Per-agent LLM configs.
  - `prompts`: Maps prompt keys to Jinja2 template files.
  - `features`: Enable/disable dice, web search, image generation.
  - `knowledge_directory`: Path to knowledge base folder.
- Prompts are Jinja2 templates located in `src/prompts/`.

---

## Testing

- Run all tests with:
  ```sh
  make test
  ```
- Tests use **mocks and fixtures** to simulate LLMs, Chainlit context, and vector stores.
- Coverage includes commands, agents, event handlers, and knowledge loading.

---

## Development

- **Run the App Locally:**
  ```sh
  make run
  ```
- **Run Tests:**
  ```sh
  make test
  ```
- **Lint and Format Code:**
