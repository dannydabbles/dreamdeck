# Dreamdeck: Your AI-Powered Storytelling Companion

Dreamdeck is an AI-powered application designed to provide a Holodeck-like experience, enabling you to create and manage immersive, collaborative stories. Whether you're a game master (GM) or a player, Dreamdeck will guide you through dynamic and engaging narratives, generate vivid storyboards, and store all your data locally for safety and accessibility.

## New Features

- **Smart Categorization of User Input:**
  - The app now categorizes user input into different buckets to handle specific actions:
    - **Roll:** If the user wants to roll dice, the app will handle the roll before continuing the story.
    - **Search:** If the user wants to look up information, the app will perform a web search using SerpAPI.
    - **Continue Story:** If the user is continuing the story, the app will generate the next part of the narrative.

## Features

- **Immersive Narratives:** The AI Game Master (GM) creates detailed, character-driven stories that adapt to your choices and preferences.
- **Vivid Storyboards:** Generate visual storyboards to bring your narrative to life.
- **Local Storage:** All your stories, characters, and elements are stored locally.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Enjoy the app in multiple languages, including English, Bengali, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Dutch, Tamil, Telugu, and Chinese (Simplified).
- **Flexible Tone:** The GM can adapt to your preferred tone, whether it's lighthearted, serious, or intense.
- **Rich Descriptions:** The GM paints vivid environments, distinct cultures, and believable characters.
- **Adaptation and Improvisation:** The GM uses "Yes, andâ€¦" or "Yes, butâ€¦" techniques to incorporate new ideas and evolve the plot organically.
- **Clear Decision Points:** The GM presents meaningful choices that impact the story's direction.
- **Neutral Ethical Stance:** The GM remains ethically neutral, responding to your direction without imposing bias.
- **Dice Roll Tool:** Add an element of chance to your game with the `/roll` command.
- **Knowledge Management:** Load and use knowledge documents to enrich the narrative.
