Testing & Debugging
To test or debug your application files and decorated functions, you will need to provide the Chainlit context to your test suite.

In your main application script or test files add:


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from chainlit.cli import run_chainlit
    run_chainlit(__file__)
Then run the script from your IDE in debug mode.

How to test a LangGraph app locally¶
This guide assumes you have a LangGraph app correctly set up with a proper configuration file and a corresponding compiled graph, and that you have a proper LangChain API key.

Testing locally ensures that there are no errors or conflicts with Python dependencies and confirms that the configuration file is specified correctly.

Setup¶
Install the LangGraph CLI package:


pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
Ensure you have an API key, which you can create from the LangSmith UI (Settings > API Keys). This is required to authenticate that you have LangGraph Cloud access. After you have saved the key to a safe place, place the following line in your .env file:


LANGSMITH_API_KEY = *********
Start the API server¶
Once you have installed the CLI, you can run the following command to start the API server for local testing:


langgraph dev
This will start up the LangGraph API server locally. If this runs successfully, you should see something like:

Ready!

API: http://localhost:2024

Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs

LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

In-Memory Mode

The langgraph dev command starts LangGraph Server in an in-memory mode. This mode is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production use, you should deploy LangGraph Server with access to a persistent storage backend.

If you want to test your application with a persistent storage backend, you can use the langgraph up command instead of langgraph dev. You will need to have docker installed on your machine to use this command.

Interact with the server¶
We can now interact with the API server using the LangGraph SDK. First, we need to start our client, select our assistant (in this case a graph we called "agent", make sure to select the proper assistant you wish to test).

You can either initialize by passing authentication or by setting an environment variable.

Initialize with authentication¶

Python
Javascript
CURL

from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# only pass the url argument to get_client() if you changed the default port when calling langgraph dev
client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>,api_key=<LANGSMITH_API_KEY>)
# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

Initialize with environment variables¶
If you have a LANGSMITH_API_KEY set in your environment, you do not need to explicitly pass authentication to the client


Python
Javascript
CURL

from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# only pass the url argument to get_client() if you changed the default port when calling langgraph dev
client = get_client()
# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

Now we can invoke our graph to ensure it is working. Make sure to change the input to match the proper schema for your graph.


Python
Javascript
CURL

input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")

If your graph works correctly, you should see your graph output displayed in the console. Of course, there are many more ways you might need to test your graph, for a full list of commands you can send with the SDK, see the Python and JS/TS references.

Testing and Evals
With PydanticAI and LLM integrations in general, there are two distinct kinds of test:

Unit tests — tests of your application code, and whether it's behaving correctly
Evals — tests of the LLM, and how good or bad its responses are
For the most part, these two kinds of tests have pretty separate goals and considerations.

Unit tests
Unit tests for PydanticAI code are just like unit tests for any other Python code.

Because for the most part they're nothing new, we have pretty well established tools and patterns for writing and running these kinds of tests.

Unless you're really sure you know better, you'll probably want to follow roughly this strategy:

Use pytest as your test harness
If you find yourself typing out long assertions, use inline-snapshot
Similarly, dirty-equals can be useful for comparing large data structures
Use TestModel or FunctionModel in place of your actual model to avoid the usage, latency and variability of real LLM calls
Use Agent.override to replace your model inside your application logic
Set ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS=False globally to block any requests from being made to non-test models accidentally
Unit testing with TestModel
The simplest and fastest way to exercise most of your application code is using TestModel, this will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return either plain text or a structured response depending on the return type of the agent.

TestModel is not magic

The "clever" (but not too clever) part of TestModel is that it will attempt to generate valid structured data for function tools and result types based on the schema of the registered tools.

There's no ML or AI in TestModel, it's just plain old procedural Python code that tries to generate data that satisfies the JSON schema of a tool.

The resulting data won't look pretty or relevant, but it should pass Pydantic's validation in most cases. If you want something more sophisticated, use FunctionModel and write your own data generation logic.

Let's write unit tests for the following application code:

weather_app.py

import asyncio
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from fake_database import DatabaseConn  
from weather_service import WeatherService  

weather_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=WeatherService,
    system_prompt='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
)


@weather_agent.tool
def weather_forecast(
    ctx: RunContext[WeatherService], location: str, forecast_date: date
) -> str:
    if forecast_date < date.today():  
        return ctx.deps.get_historic_weather(location, forecast_date)
    else:
        return ctx.deps.get_forecast(location, forecast_date)


async def run_weather_forecast(  
    user_prompts: list[tuple[str, int]], conn: DatabaseConn
):
    """Run weather forecast for a list of user prompts and save."""
    async with WeatherService() as weather_service:

        async def run_forecast(prompt: str, user_id: int):
            result = await weather_agent.run(prompt, deps=weather_service)
            await conn.store_forecast(user_id, result.data)

        # run all prompts in parallel
        await asyncio.gather(
            *(run_forecast(prompt, user_id) for (prompt, user_id) in user_prompts)
        )
Here we have a function that takes a list of (user_prompt, user_id) tuples, gets a weather forecast for each prompt, and stores the result in the database.

We want to test this code without having to mock certain objects or modify our code so we can pass test objects in.

Here's how we would write tests using TestModel:

test_weather_app.py

from datetime import timezone
import pytest

from dirty_equals import IsNow

from pydantic_ai import models, capture_run_messages
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelResponse,
    SystemPromptPart,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
    ToolReturnPart,
    UserPromptPart,
    ModelRequest,
)

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio  
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False  


async def test_forecast():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with capture_run_messages() as messages:
        with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):  
            prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?'
            await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)  

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == '{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}'  

    assert messages == [  
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                SystemPromptPart(
                    content='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
                ),
                UserPromptPart(
                    content='What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?',
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),  
                ),
            ]
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                ToolCallPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    args={
                        'location': 'a',
                        'forecast_date': '2024-01-01',  
                    },
                    tool_call_id=None,
                )
            ],
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                ToolReturnPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    content='Sunny with a chance of rain',
                    tool_call_id=None,
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
                ),
            ],
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                TextPart(
                    content='{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}',
                )
            ],
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
    ]
Unit testing with FunctionModel
The above tests are a great start, but careful readers will notice that the WeatherService.get_forecast is never called since TestModel calls weather_forecast with a date in the past.

To fully exercise weather_forecast, we need to use FunctionModel to customise how the tools is called.

Here's an example of using FunctionModel to test the weather_forecast tool with custom inputs

test_weather_app2.py

import re

import pytest

from pydantic_ai import models
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelMessage,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False


def call_weather_forecast(  
    messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo
) -> ModelResponse:
    if len(messages) == 1:
        # first call, call the weather forecast tool
        user_prompt = messages[0].parts[-1]
        m = re.search(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', user_prompt.content)
        assert m is not None
        args = {'location': 'London', 'forecast_date': m.group()}  
        return ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart('weather_forecast', args)])
    else:
        # second call, return the forecast
        msg = messages[-1].parts[0]
        assert msg.part_kind == 'tool-return'
        return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(f'The forecast is: {msg.content}')])


async def test_forecast_future():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with weather_agent.override(model=FunctionModel(call_weather_forecast)):  
        prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2032-01-01?'
        await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == 'The forecast is: Rainy with a chance of sun'
Overriding model via pytest fixtures
If you're writing lots of tests that all require model to be overridden, you can use pytest fixtures to override the model with TestModel or FunctionModel in a reusable way.

Here's an example of a fixture that overrides the model with TestModel:

tests.py

import pytest
from weather_app import weather_agent

from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel


@pytest.fixture
def override_weather_agent():
    with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):
        yield


async def test_forecast(override_weather_agent: None):
    ...
    # test code here
Evals
"Evals" refers to evaluating a models performance for a specific application.

Warning

Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.

Evals are generally more like benchmarks than unit tests, they never "pass" although they do "fail"; you care mostly about how they change over time.

Since evals need to be run against the real model, then can be slow and expensive to run, you generally won't want to run them in CI for every commit.

Measuring performance
The hardest part of evals is measuring how well the model has performed.

In some cases (e.g. an agent to generate SQL) there are simple, easy to run tests that can be used to measure performance (e.g. is the SQL valid? Does it return the right results? Does it return just the right results?).

In other cases (e.g. an agent that gives advice on quitting smoking) it can be very hard or impossible to make quantitative measures of performance — in the smoking case you'd really need to run a double-blind trial over months, then wait 40 years and observe health outcomes to know if changes to your prompt were an improvement.

There are a few different strategies you can use to measure performance:

End to end, self-contained tests — like the SQL example, we can test the final result of the agent near-instantly
Synthetic self-contained tests — writing unit test style checks that the output is as expected, checks like 'chewing gum' in response, while these checks might seem simplistic they can be helpful, one nice characteristic is that it's easy to tell what's wrong when they fail
LLMs evaluating LLMs — using another models, or even the same model with a different prompt to evaluate the performance of the agent (like when the class marks each other's homework because the teacher has a hangover), while the downsides and complexities of this approach are obvious, some think it can be a useful tool in the right circumstances
Evals in prod — measuring the end results of the agent in production, then creating a quantitative measure of performance, so you can easily measure changes over time as you change the prompt or model used, logfire can be extremely useful in this case since you can write a custom query to measure the performance of your agent
System prompt customization
The system prompt is the developer's primary tool in controlling an agent's behavior, so it's often useful to be able to customise the system prompt and see how performance changes. This is particularly relevant when the system prompt contains a list of examples and you want to understand how changing that list affects the model's performance.

Let's assume we have the following app for running SQL generated from a user prompt (this examples omits a lot of details for brevity, see the SQL gen example for a more complete code):

sql_app.py

import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from fake_database import DatabaseConn


class SqlSystemPrompt:  
    def __init__(
        self, examples: Union[list[dict[str, str]], None] = None, db: str = 'PostgreSQL'
    ):
        if examples is None:
            # if examples aren't provided, load them from file, this is the default
            with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
                self.examples = json.load(f)
        else:
            self.examples = examples

        self.db = db

    def build_prompt(self) -> str:  
        return f"""\
Given the following {self.db} table of records, your job is to
write a SQL query that suits the user's request.

Database schema:
CREATE TABLE records (
  ...
);

{''.join(self.format_example(example) for example in self.examples)}
"""

    @staticmethod
    def format_example(example: dict[str, str]) -> str:  
        return f"""\
<example>
  <request>{example['request']}</request>
  <sql>{example['sql']}</sql>
</example>
"""


sql_agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=SqlSystemPrompt,
)


@sql_agent.system_prompt
async def system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[SqlSystemPrompt]) -> str:
    return ctx.deps.build_prompt()


async def user_search(user_prompt: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Search the database based on the user's prompts."""
    ...  
    result = await sql_agent.run(user_prompt, deps=SqlSystemPrompt())
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    return await conn.execute(result.data)
examples.json looks something like this:


request: show me error records with the tag "foobar"
response: SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags)
examples.json

{
  "examples": [
    {
      "request": "Show me all records",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records;"
    },
    {
      "request": "Show me all records from 2021",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE date_trunc('year', date) = '2021-01-01';"
    },
    {
      "request": "show me error records with the tag 'foobar'",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags);"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Now we want a way to quantify the success of the SQL generation so we can judge how changes to the agent affect its performance.

We can use Agent.override to replace the system prompt with a custom one that uses a subset of examples, and then run the application code (in this case user_search). We also run the actual SQL from the examples and compare the "correct" result from the example SQL to the SQL generated by the agent. (We compare the results of running the SQL rather than the SQL itself since the SQL might be semantically equivalent but written in a different way).

To get a quantitative measure of performance, we assign points to each run as follows:

-100 points if the generated SQL is invalid
-1 point for each row returned by the agent (so returning lots of results is discouraged)
+5 points for each row returned by the agent that matches the expected result
We use 5-fold cross-validation to judge the performance of the agent using our existing set of examples.

sql_app_evals.py

import json
import statistics
from pathlib import Path
from itertools import chain

from fake_database import DatabaseConn, QueryError
from sql_app import sql_agent, SqlSystemPrompt, user_search


async def main():
    with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
        examples = json.load(f)

    # split examples into 5 folds
    fold_size = len(examples) // 5
    folds = [examples[i : i + fold_size] for i in range(0, len(examples), fold_size)]
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    scores = []

    for i, fold in enumerate(folds):
        fold_score = 0
        # build all other folds into a list of examples
        other_folds = list(chain(*(f for j, f in enumerate(folds) if j != i)))
        # create a new system prompt with the other fold examples
        system_prompt = SqlSystemPrompt(examples=other_folds)

        # override the system prompt with the new one
        with sql_agent.override(deps=system_prompt):
            for case in fold:
                try:
                    agent_results = await user_search(case['request'])
                except QueryError as e:
                    print(f'Fold {i} {case}: {e}')
                    fold_score -= 100
                else:
                    # get the expected results using the SQL from this case
                    expected_results = await conn.execute(case['sql'])

                agent_ids = [r['id'] for r in agent_results]
                # each returned value has a score of -1
                fold_score -= len(agent_ids)
                expected_ids = {r['id'] for r in expected_results}

                # each return value that matches the expected value has a score of 3
                fold_score += 5 * len(set(agent_ids) & expected_ids)

        scores.append(fold_score)

    overall_score = statistics.mean(scores)
    print(f'Overall score: {overall_score:0.2f}')
    #> Overall score: 12.00
We can then change the prompt, the model, or the examples and see how the score changes over time.

How to review tool calls (Functional API)¶
Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Implementing human-in-the-loop workflows with interrupt
How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API
This guide demonstrates how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in a ReAct agent using the LangGraph Functional API.

We will build off of the agent created in the How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API guide.

Specifically, we will demonstrate how to review tool calls generated by a chat model prior to their execution. This can be accomplished through use of the interrupt function at key points in our application.

Preview:

We will implement a simple function that reviews tool calls generated from our chat model and call it from inside our application's entrypoint:


def review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:
    """Review a tool call, returning a validated version."""
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call,
        }
    )
    review_action = human_review["action"]
    review_data = human_review.get("data")
    if review_action == "continue":
        return tool_call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{"args": review_data}}
        return updated_tool_call
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        return ToolMessage(
            content=review_data, name=tool_call["name"], tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]
        )
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:


%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Set up LangSmith for better debugging

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs.

Define model and tools¶
Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. As in the ReAct agent guide, we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.

We will use an OpenAI chat model for this example, but any model supporting tool-calling will suffice.


from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"


tools = [get_weather]
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool

Define tasks¶
Our tasks are unchanged from the ReAct agent guide:

Call model: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
Call tool: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

from langchain_core.messages import ToolCall, ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task


tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}


@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response


@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call["args"])
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])
API Reference: ToolCall | ToolMessage | entrypoint | task

Define entrypoint¶
To review tool calls before execution, we add a review_tool_call function that calls interrupt. When this function is called, execution will be paused until we issue a command to resume it.

Given a tool call, our function will interrupt for human review. At that point we can either:

Accept the tool call;
Revise the tool call and continue;
Generate a custom tool message (e.g., instructing the model to re-format its tool call).
We will demonstrate these three cases in the usage examples below.


from typing import Union


def review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:
    """Review a tool call, returning a validated version."""
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call,
        }
    )
    review_action = human_review["action"]
    review_data = human_review.get("data")
    if review_action == "continue":
        return tool_call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{"args": review_data}}
        return updated_tool_call
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        return ToolMessage(
            content=review_data, name=tool_call["name"], tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]
        )
We can now update our entrypoint to review the generated tool calls. If a tool call is accepted or revised, we execute in the same way as before. Otherwise, we just append the ToolMessage supplied by the human.

Tip

The results of prior tasks — in this case the initial model call — are persisted, so that they are not run again following the interrupt.


from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt


checkpointer = MemorySaver()


@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Review tool calls
        tool_results = []
        tool_calls = []
        for i, tool_call in enumerate(llm_response.tool_calls):
            review = review_tool_call(tool_call)
            if isinstance(review, ToolMessage):
                tool_results.append(review)
            else:  # is a validated tool call
                tool_calls.append(review)
                if review != tool_call:
                    llm_response.tool_calls[i] = review  # update message

        # Execute remaining tool calls
        tool_result_futures = [call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
        remaining_tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(
            messages,
            [llm_response, *tool_results, *remaining_tool_results],
        )

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)

Usage¶
Let's demonstrate some scenarios.


def _print_step(step: dict) -> None:
    for task_name, result in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # just stream from tasks
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        if task_name in ("__interrupt__", "review_tool_call"):
            print(result)
        else:
            result.pretty_print()
Accept a tool call¶
To accept a tool call, we just indicate in the data we provide in the Command that the tool call should pass through.


config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd)
 Call ID: call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:22fcc9cd-3573-b39b-eea7-272a025903e2'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(resume={"action": "continue"})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!
Revise a tool call¶
To revise a tool call, we can supply updated arguments.


config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N)
 Call ID: call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N
  Args:
    location: san francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'san francisco'}, 'id': 'call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:9559a81d-5720-dc19-a457-457bac7bdd83'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(resume={"action": "update", "data": {"location": "SF, CA"}})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!
The LangSmith traces for this run are particularly informative:
In the trace before the interrupt, we generate a tool call for location "San Francisco".
In the trace after resuming, we see that the tool call in the message has been updated to "SF, CA".
Generate a custom ToolMessage¶
To Generate a custom ToolMessage, we supply the content of the message. In this case we will ask the model to reformat its tool call.


config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18)
 Call ID: call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:4b3b372b-9da3-70be-5c68-3d9317346070'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(
    resume={
        "action": "feedback",
        "data": "Please format as <City>, <State>.",
    },
)

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp)
 Call ID: call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp
  Args:
    location: San Francisco, CA

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco, CA'}, 'id': 'call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:4b3b372b-9da3-70be-5c68-3d9317346070'], when='during'),)
Once it is re-formatted, we can accept it:

human_input = Command(resume={"action": "continue"})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco, CA is sunny!

Multi-agent Systems¶
An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. As you develop these systems, they might grow more complex over time, making them harder to manage and scale. For example, you might run into the following problems:

agent has too many tools at its disposal and makes poor decisions about which tool to call next
context grows too complex for a single agent to keep track of
there is a need for multiple specialization areas in the system (e.g. planner, researcher, math expert, etc.)
To tackle these, you might consider breaking your application into multiple smaller, independent agents and composing them into a multi-agent system. These independent agents can be as simple as a prompt and an LLM call, or as complex as a ReAct agent (and more!).

The primary benefits of using multi-agent systems are:

Modularity: Separate agents make it easier to develop, test, and maintain agentic systems.
Specialization: You can create expert agents focused on specific domains, which helps with the overall system performance.
Control: You can explicitly control how agents communicate (as opposed to relying on function calling).
Multi-agent architectures¶


There are several ways to connect agents in a multi-agent system:

Network: each agent can communicate with every other agent. Any agent can decide which other agent to call next.
Supervisor: each agent communicates with a single supervisor agent. Supervisor agent makes decisions on which agent should be called next.
Supervisor (tool-calling): this is a special case of supervisor architecture. Individual agents can be represented as tools. In this case, a supervisor agent uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which of the agent tools to call, as well as the arguments to pass to those agents.
Hierarchical: you can define a multi-agent system with a supervisor of supervisors. This is a generalization of the supervisor architecture and allows for more complex control flows.
Custom multi-agent workflow: each agent communicates with only a subset of agents. Parts of the flow are deterministic, and only some agents can decide which other agents to call next.
Handoffs¶
In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

destination: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the node to go to)
payload: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update)
To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return Command object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates:


def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent"]]:
    # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
    goto = get_next_agent(...)  # 'agent' / 'another_agent'
    return Command(
        # Specify which agent to call next
        goto=goto,
        # Update the graph state
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"}
    )
In a more complex scenario where each agent node is itself a graph (i.e., a subgraph), a node in one of the agent subgraphs might want to navigate to a different agent. For example, if you have two agents, alice and bob (subgraph nodes in a parent graph), and alice needs to navigate to bob, you can set graph=Command.PARENT in the Command object:


def some_node_inside_alice(state)
    return Command(
        goto="bob",
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"},
        # specify which graph to navigate to (defaults to the current graph)
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )
Note

If you need to support visualization for subgraphs communicating using Command(graph=Command.PARENT) you would need to wrap them in a node function with Command annotation, e.g. instead of this:


builder.add_node(alice)
you would need to do this:


def call_alice(state) -> Command[Literal["bob"]]:
    return alice.invoke(state)

builder.add_node("alice", call_alice)
Handoffs as tools¶
One of the most common agent types is a ReAct-style tool-calling agents. For those types of agents, a common pattern is wrapping a handoff in a tool call, e.g.:


def transfer_to_bob(state):
    """Transfer to bob."""
    return Command(
        goto="bob",
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"},
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )
This is a special case of updating the graph state from tools where in addition the state update, the control flow is included as well.

Important

If you want to use tools that return Command, you can either use prebuilt create_react_agent / ToolNode components, or implement your own tool-executing node that collects Command objects returned by the tools and returns a list of them, e.g.:


def call_tools(state):
    ...
    commands = [tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
    return commands
Let's now take a closer look at the different multi-agent architectures.

Network¶
In this architecture, agents are defined as graph nodes. Each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. This architecture is good for problems that do not have a clear hierarchy of agents or a specific sequence in which agents should be called.


from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

model = ChatOpenAI()

def agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_2", "agent_3", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_agent" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the agents or exit based on the LLM's decision
    # if the LLM returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],
        update={"messages": [response["content"]]},
    )

def agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_3", END]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],
        update={"messages": [response["content"]]},
    )

def agent_3(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", END]]:
    ...
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],
        update={"messages": [response["content"]]},
    )

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)
builder.add_node(agent_3)

builder.add_edge(START, "agent_1")
network = builder.compile()
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | Command | StateGraph | START | END

Supervisor¶
In this architecture, we define agents as nodes and add a supervisor node (LLM) that decides which agent nodes should be called next. We use Command to route execution to the appropriate agent node based on supervisor's decision. This architecture also lends itself well to running multiple agents in parallel or using map-reduce pattern.


from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

model = ChatOpenAI()

def supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_agent" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the agents or exit based on the supervisor's decision
    # if the supervisor returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(goto=response["next_agent"])

def agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto="supervisor",
        update={"messages": [response]},
    )

def agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto="supervisor",
        update={"messages": [response]},
    )

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(supervisor)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)

builder.add_edge(START, "supervisor")

supervisor = builder.compile()
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | Command | StateGraph | START | END

Check out this tutorial for an example of supervisor multi-agent architecture.

Supervisor (tool-calling)¶
In this variant of the supervisor architecture, we define individual agents as tools and use a tool-calling LLM in the supervisor node. This can be implemented as a ReAct-style agent with two nodes — an LLM node (supervisor) and a tool-calling node that executes tools (agents in this case).


from typing import Annotated
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState, create_react_agent

model = ChatOpenAI()

# this is the agent function that will be called as tool
# notice that you can pass the state to the tool via InjectedState annotation
def agent_1(state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState]):
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # return the LLM response as a string (expected tool response format)
    # this will be automatically turned to ToolMessage
    # by the prebuilt create_react_agent (supervisor)
    return response.content

def agent_2(state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState]):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return response.content

tools = [agent_1, agent_2]
# the simplest way to build a supervisor w/ tool-calling is to use prebuilt ReAct agent graph
# that consists of a tool-calling LLM node (i.e. supervisor) and a tool-executing node
supervisor = create_react_agent(model, tools)
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | InjectedState | create_react_agent

Hierarchical¶
As you add more agents to your system, it might become too hard for the supervisor to manage all of them. The supervisor might start making poor decisions about which agent to call next, the context might become too complex for a single supervisor to keep track of. In other words, you end up with the same problems that motivated the multi-agent architecture in the first place.

To address this, you can design your system hierarchically. For example, you can create separate, specialized teams of agents managed by individual supervisors, and a top-level supervisor to manage the teams.


from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command
model = ChatOpenAI()

# define team 1 (same as the single supervisor example above)

def team_1_supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_agent_1", "team_1_agent_2", END]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto=response["next_agent"])

def team_1_agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto="team_1_supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})

def team_1_agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto="team_1_supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})

team_1_builder = StateGraph(Team1State)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_supervisor)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_agent_1)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_agent_2)
team_1_builder.add_edge(START, "team_1_supervisor")
team_1_graph = team_1_builder.compile()

# define team 2 (same as the single supervisor example above)
class Team2State(MessagesState):
    next: Literal["team_2_agent_1", "team_2_agent_2", "__end__"]

def team_2_supervisor(state: Team2State):
    ...

def team_2_agent_1(state: Team2State):
    ...

def team_2_agent_2(state: Team2State):
    ...

team_2_builder = StateGraph(Team2State)
...
team_2_graph = team_2_builder.compile()


# define top-level supervisor

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
def top_level_supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_graph", "team_2_graph", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which team to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_team" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the teams or exit based on the supervisor's decision
    # if the supervisor returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(goto=response["next_team"])

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(top_level_supervisor)
builder.add_node("team_1_graph", team_1_graph)
builder.add_node("team_2_graph", team_2_graph)
builder.add_edge(START, "top_level_supervisor")
builder.add_edge("team_1_graph", "top_level_supervisor")
builder.add_edge("team_2_graph", "top_level_supervisor")
graph = builder.compile()
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | StateGraph | START | END | Command

Custom multi-agent workflow¶
In this architecture we add individual agents as graph nodes and define the order in which agents are called ahead of time, in a custom workflow. In LangGraph the workflow can be defined in two ways:

Explicit control flow (normal edges): LangGraph allows you to explicitly define the control flow of your application (i.e. the sequence of how agents communicate) explicitly, via normal graph edges. This is the most deterministic variant of this architecture above — we always know which agent will be called next ahead of time.

Dynamic control flow (Command): in LangGraph you can allow LLMs to decide parts of your application control flow. This can be achieved by using Command. A special case of this is a supervisor tool-calling architecture. In that case, the tool-calling LLM powering the supervisor agent will make decisions about the order in which the tools (agents) are being called.


from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START

model = ChatOpenAI()

def agent_1(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return {"messages": [response]}

def agent_2(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return {"messages": [response]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)
# define the flow explicitly
builder.add_edge(START, "agent_1")
builder.add_edge("agent_1", "agent_2")
API Reference: ChatOpenAI | StateGraph | START

Communication between agents¶
The most important thing when building multi-agent systems is figuring out how the agents communicate. There are few different considerations:

Do agents communicate via via graph state or via tool calls?
What if two agents have different state schemas?
How to communicate over a shared message list?
Graph state vs tool calls¶
What is the "payload" that is being passed around between agents? In most of the architectures discussed above the agents communicate via the graph state. In the case of the supervisor with tool-calling, the payloads are tool call arguments.



Graph state¶
To communicate via graph state, individual agents need to be defined as graph nodes. These can be added as functions or as entire subgraphs. At each step of the graph execution, agent node receives the current state of the graph, executes the agent code and then passes the updated state to the next nodes.

Typically agent nodes share a single state schema. However, you might want to design agent nodes with different state schemas.

Different state schemas¶
An agent might need to have a different state schema from the rest of the agents. For example, a search agent might only need to keep track of queries and retrieved documents. There are two ways to achieve this in LangGraph:

Define subgraph agents with a separate state schema. If there are no shared state keys (channels) between the subgraph and the parent graph, it’s important to add input / output transformations so that the parent graph knows how to communicate with the subgraphs.
Define agent node functions with a private input state schema that is distinct from the overall graph state schema. This allows passing information that is only needed for executing that particular agent.
Shared message list¶
The most common way for the agents to communicate is via a shared state channel, typically a list of messages. This assumes that there is always at least a single channel (key) in the state that is shared by the agents. When communicating via a shared message list there is an additional consideration: should the agents share the full history of their thought process or only the final result?



Share full history¶
Agents can share the full history of their thought process (i.e. "scratchpad") with all other agents. This "scratchpad" would typically look like a list of messages. The benefit of sharing full thought process is that it might help other agents make better decisions and improve reasoning ability for the system as a whole. The downside is that as the number of agents and their complexity grows, the "scratchpad" will grow quickly and might require additional strategies for memory management.

Share final result¶
Agents can have their own private "scratchpad" and only share the final result with the rest of the agents. This approach might work better for systems with many agents or agents that are more complex. In this case, you would need to define agents with different state schemas

For agents called as tools, the supervisor determines the inputs based on the tool schema. Additionally, LangGraph allows passing state to individual tools at runtime, so subordinate agents can access parent state, if needed.
