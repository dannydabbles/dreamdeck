Testing & Debugging
To test or debug your application files and decorated functions, you will need to provide the Chainlit context to your test suite.

In your main application script or test files add:


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from chainlit.cli import run_chainlit
    run_chainlit(__file__)
Then run the script from your IDE in debug mode.

How to test a LangGraph app locally¶
This guide assumes you have a LangGraph app correctly set up with a proper configuration file and a corresponding compiled graph, and that you have a proper LangChain API key.

Testing locally ensures that there are no errors or conflicts with Python dependencies and confirms that the configuration file is specified correctly.

Setup¶
Install the LangGraph CLI package:


pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
Ensure you have an API key, which you can create from the LangSmith UI (Settings > API Keys). This is required to authenticate that you have LangGraph Cloud access. After you have saved the key to a safe place, place the following line in your .env file:


LANGSMITH_API_KEY = *********
Start the API server¶
Once you have installed the CLI, you can run the following command to start the API server for local testing:


langgraph dev
This will start up the LangGraph API server locally. If this runs successfully, you should see something like:

Ready!

API: http://localhost:2024

Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs

LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

In-Memory Mode

The langgraph dev command starts LangGraph Server in an in-memory mode. This mode is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production use, you should deploy LangGraph Server with access to a persistent storage backend.

If you want to test your application with a persistent storage backend, you can use the langgraph up command instead of langgraph dev. You will need to have docker installed on your machine to use this command.

Interact with the server¶
We can now interact with the API server using the LangGraph SDK. First, we need to start our client, select our assistant (in this case a graph we called "agent", make sure to select the proper assistant you wish to test).

You can either initialize by passing authentication or by setting an environment variable.

Initialize with authentication¶

Python
Javascript
CURL

from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# only pass the url argument to get_client() if you changed the default port when calling langgraph dev
client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>,api_key=<LANGSMITH_API_KEY>)
# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

Initialize with environment variables¶
If you have a LANGSMITH_API_KEY set in your environment, you do not need to explicitly pass authentication to the client


Python
Javascript
CURL

from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# only pass the url argument to get_client() if you changed the default port when calling langgraph dev
client = get_client()
# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

Now we can invoke our graph to ensure it is working. Make sure to change the input to match the proper schema for your graph.


Python
Javascript
CURL

input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")

If your graph works correctly, you should see your graph output displayed in the console. Of course, there are many more ways you might need to test your graph, for a full list of commands you can send with the SDK, see the Python and JS/TS references.

Testing and Evals
With PydanticAI and LLM integrations in general, there are two distinct kinds of test:

Unit tests — tests of your application code, and whether it's behaving correctly
Evals — tests of the LLM, and how good or bad its responses are
For the most part, these two kinds of tests have pretty separate goals and considerations.

Unit tests
Unit tests for PydanticAI code are just like unit tests for any other Python code.

Because for the most part they're nothing new, we have pretty well established tools and patterns for writing and running these kinds of tests.

Unless you're really sure you know better, you'll probably want to follow roughly this strategy:

Use pytest as your test harness
If you find yourself typing out long assertions, use inline-snapshot
Similarly, dirty-equals can be useful for comparing large data structures
Use TestModel or FunctionModel in place of your actual model to avoid the usage, latency and variability of real LLM calls
Use Agent.override to replace your model inside your application logic
Set ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS=False globally to block any requests from being made to non-test models accidentally
Unit testing with TestModel
The simplest and fastest way to exercise most of your application code is using TestModel, this will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return either plain text or a structured response depending on the return type of the agent.

TestModel is not magic

The "clever" (but not too clever) part of TestModel is that it will attempt to generate valid structured data for function tools and result types based on the schema of the registered tools.

There's no ML or AI in TestModel, it's just plain old procedural Python code that tries to generate data that satisfies the JSON schema of a tool.

The resulting data won't look pretty or relevant, but it should pass Pydantic's validation in most cases. If you want something more sophisticated, use FunctionModel and write your own data generation logic.

Let's write unit tests for the following application code:

weather_app.py

import asyncio
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from fake_database import DatabaseConn  
from weather_service import WeatherService  

weather_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=WeatherService,
    system_prompt='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
)


@weather_agent.tool
def weather_forecast(
    ctx: RunContext[WeatherService], location: str, forecast_date: date
) -> str:
    if forecast_date < date.today():  
        return ctx.deps.get_historic_weather(location, forecast_date)
    else:
        return ctx.deps.get_forecast(location, forecast_date)


async def run_weather_forecast(  
    user_prompts: list[tuple[str, int]], conn: DatabaseConn
):
    """Run weather forecast for a list of user prompts and save."""
    async with WeatherService() as weather_service:

        async def run_forecast(prompt: str, user_id: int):
            result = await weather_agent.run(prompt, deps=weather_service)
            await conn.store_forecast(user_id, result.data)

        # run all prompts in parallel
        await asyncio.gather(
            *(run_forecast(prompt, user_id) for (prompt, user_id) in user_prompts)
        )
Here we have a function that takes a list of (user_prompt, user_id) tuples, gets a weather forecast for each prompt, and stores the result in the database.

We want to test this code without having to mock certain objects or modify our code so we can pass test objects in.

Here's how we would write tests using TestModel:

test_weather_app.py

from datetime import timezone
import pytest

from dirty_equals import IsNow

from pydantic_ai import models, capture_run_messages
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelResponse,
    SystemPromptPart,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
    ToolReturnPart,
    UserPromptPart,
    ModelRequest,
)

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio  
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False  


async def test_forecast():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with capture_run_messages() as messages:
        with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):  
            prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?'
            await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)  

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == '{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}'  

    assert messages == [  
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                SystemPromptPart(
                    content='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
                ),
                UserPromptPart(
                    content='What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?',
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),  
                ),
            ]
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                ToolCallPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    args={
                        'location': 'a',
                        'forecast_date': '2024-01-01',  
                    },
                    tool_call_id=None,
                )
            ],
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                ToolReturnPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    content='Sunny with a chance of rain',
                    tool_call_id=None,
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
                ),
            ],
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                TextPart(
                    content='{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}',
                )
            ],
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
    ]
Unit testing with FunctionModel
The above tests are a great start, but careful readers will notice that the WeatherService.get_forecast is never called since TestModel calls weather_forecast with a date in the past.

To fully exercise weather_forecast, we need to use FunctionModel to customise how the tools is called.

Here's an example of using FunctionModel to test the weather_forecast tool with custom inputs

test_weather_app2.py

import re

import pytest

from pydantic_ai import models
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelMessage,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False


def call_weather_forecast(  
    messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo
) -> ModelResponse:
    if len(messages) == 1:
        # first call, call the weather forecast tool
        user_prompt = messages[0].parts[-1]
        m = re.search(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', user_prompt.content)
        assert m is not None
        args = {'location': 'London', 'forecast_date': m.group()}  
        return ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart('weather_forecast', args)])
    else:
        # second call, return the forecast
        msg = messages[-1].parts[0]
        assert msg.part_kind == 'tool-return'
        return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(f'The forecast is: {msg.content}')])


async def test_forecast_future():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with weather_agent.override(model=FunctionModel(call_weather_forecast)):  
        prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2032-01-01?'
        await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == 'The forecast is: Rainy with a chance of sun'
Overriding model via pytest fixtures
If you're writing lots of tests that all require model to be overridden, you can use pytest fixtures to override the model with TestModel or FunctionModel in a reusable way.

Here's an example of a fixture that overrides the model with TestModel:

tests.py

import pytest
from weather_app import weather_agent

from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel


@pytest.fixture
def override_weather_agent():
    with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):
        yield


async def test_forecast(override_weather_agent: None):
    ...
    # test code here
Evals
"Evals" refers to evaluating a models performance for a specific application.

Warning

Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.

Evals are generally more like benchmarks than unit tests, they never "pass" although they do "fail"; you care mostly about how they change over time.

Since evals need to be run against the real model, then can be slow and expensive to run, you generally won't want to run them in CI for every commit.

Measuring performance
The hardest part of evals is measuring how well the model has performed.

In some cases (e.g. an agent to generate SQL) there are simple, easy to run tests that can be used to measure performance (e.g. is the SQL valid? Does it return the right results? Does it return just the right results?).

In other cases (e.g. an agent that gives advice on quitting smoking) it can be very hard or impossible to make quantitative measures of performance — in the smoking case you'd really need to run a double-blind trial over months, then wait 40 years and observe health outcomes to know if changes to your prompt were an improvement.

There are a few different strategies you can use to measure performance:

End to end, self-contained tests — like the SQL example, we can test the final result of the agent near-instantly
Synthetic self-contained tests — writing unit test style checks that the output is as expected, checks like 'chewing gum' in response, while these checks might seem simplistic they can be helpful, one nice characteristic is that it's easy to tell what's wrong when they fail
LLMs evaluating LLMs — using another models, or even the same model with a different prompt to evaluate the performance of the agent (like when the class marks each other's homework because the teacher has a hangover), while the downsides and complexities of this approach are obvious, some think it can be a useful tool in the right circumstances
Evals in prod — measuring the end results of the agent in production, then creating a quantitative measure of performance, so you can easily measure changes over time as you change the prompt or model used, logfire can be extremely useful in this case since you can write a custom query to measure the performance of your agent
System prompt customization
The system prompt is the developer's primary tool in controlling an agent's behavior, so it's often useful to be able to customise the system prompt and see how performance changes. This is particularly relevant when the system prompt contains a list of examples and you want to understand how changing that list affects the model's performance.

Let's assume we have the following app for running SQL generated from a user prompt (this examples omits a lot of details for brevity, see the SQL gen example for a more complete code):

sql_app.py

import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from fake_database import DatabaseConn


class SqlSystemPrompt:  
    def __init__(
        self, examples: Union[list[dict[str, str]], None] = None, db: str = 'PostgreSQL'
    ):
        if examples is None:
            # if examples aren't provided, load them from file, this is the default
            with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
                self.examples = json.load(f)
        else:
            self.examples = examples

        self.db = db

    def build_prompt(self) -> str:  
        return f"""\
Given the following {self.db} table of records, your job is to
write a SQL query that suits the user's request.

Database schema:
CREATE TABLE records (
  ...
);

{''.join(self.format_example(example) for example in self.examples)}
"""

    @staticmethod
    def format_example(example: dict[str, str]) -> str:  
        return f"""\
<example>
  <request>{example['request']}</request>
  <sql>{example['sql']}</sql>
</example>
"""


sql_agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=SqlSystemPrompt,
)


@sql_agent.system_prompt
async def system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[SqlSystemPrompt]) -> str:
    return ctx.deps.build_prompt()


async def user_search(user_prompt: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Search the database based on the user's prompts."""
    ...  
    result = await sql_agent.run(user_prompt, deps=SqlSystemPrompt())
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    return await conn.execute(result.data)
examples.json looks something like this:


request: show me error records with the tag "foobar"
response: SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags)
examples.json

{
  "examples": [
    {
      "request": "Show me all records",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records;"
    },
    {
      "request": "Show me all records from 2021",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE date_trunc('year', date) = '2021-01-01';"
    },
    {
      "request": "show me error records with the tag 'foobar'",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags);"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Now we want a way to quantify the success of the SQL generation so we can judge how changes to the agent affect its performance.

We can use Agent.override to replace the system prompt with a custom one that uses a subset of examples, and then run the application code (in this case user_search). We also run the actual SQL from the examples and compare the "correct" result from the example SQL to the SQL generated by the agent. (We compare the results of running the SQL rather than the SQL itself since the SQL might be semantically equivalent but written in a different way).

To get a quantitative measure of performance, we assign points to each run as follows:

-100 points if the generated SQL is invalid
-1 point for each row returned by the agent (so returning lots of results is discouraged)
+5 points for each row returned by the agent that matches the expected result
We use 5-fold cross-validation to judge the performance of the agent using our existing set of examples.

sql_app_evals.py

import json
import statistics
from pathlib import Path
from itertools import chain

from fake_database import DatabaseConn, QueryError
from sql_app import sql_agent, SqlSystemPrompt, user_search


async def main():
    with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
        examples = json.load(f)

    # split examples into 5 folds
    fold_size = len(examples) // 5
    folds = [examples[i : i + fold_size] for i in range(0, len(examples), fold_size)]
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    scores = []

    for i, fold in enumerate(folds):
        fold_score = 0
        # build all other folds into a list of examples
        other_folds = list(chain(*(f for j, f in enumerate(folds) if j != i)))
        # create a new system prompt with the other fold examples
        system_prompt = SqlSystemPrompt(examples=other_folds)

        # override the system prompt with the new one
        with sql_agent.override(deps=system_prompt):
            for case in fold:
                try:
                    agent_results = await user_search(case['request'])
                except QueryError as e:
                    print(f'Fold {i} {case}: {e}')
                    fold_score -= 100
                else:
                    # get the expected results using the SQL from this case
                    expected_results = await conn.execute(case['sql'])

                agent_ids = [r['id'] for r in agent_results]
                # each returned value has a score of -1
                fold_score -= len(agent_ids)
                expected_ids = {r['id'] for r in expected_results}

                # each return value that matches the expected value has a score of 3
                fold_score += 5 * len(set(agent_ids) & expected_ids)

        scores.append(fold_score)

    overall_score = statistics.mean(scores)
    print(f'Overall score: {overall_score:0.2f}')
    #> Overall score: 12.00
We can then change the prompt, the model, or the examples and see how the score changes over time.
