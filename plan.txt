# Enhanced Plan for Dreamdeck Application

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for adding comprehensive testing to the Dreamdeck application, focusing on unit, smoke, and integration testing. The goal is to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability while leveraging the latest features from LangGraph and Chainlit.

## 1. Testing Strategy

### A. Unit Testing
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Scope:**
  - Core logic in `tools_and_agents.py`, `state.py`, and `memory_management.py`
  - Data models in `models.py`
  - Configuration handling in `config.py`
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Implement pytest fixtures for common test setups
  2. Add mocking for external dependencies (e.g., API calls, database interactions)
  3. Write tests for key functions and edge cases

### B. Integration Testing
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Test interactions between components and subsystems.
- **Scope:**
  - Chat workflows
  - Image generation pipelines
  - Database interactions
  - API endpoints
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Implement FastAPI test client integration
  2. Add tests for API endpoints
  3. Test core workflows (e.g., dice rolling, web search, story generation)

### C. Smoke Testing
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Verify basic application functionality.
- **Scope:**
  - Application startup
  - Basic user interactions
  - Core feature verification (e.g., story generation)
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Add tests to verify application startup
  2. Test basic user interactions
  3. Verify core features

### D. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Simulate complete user workflows.
- **Scope:**
  - Full story generation
  - Complex user interactions
  - Error recovery scenarios
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Implement test scenarios for complete story generation
  2. Add tests for complex interactions
  3. Test error recovery

  3. Write unit tests for core components
  4. Add test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement FastAPI test client integration
  2. Add tests for API endpoints
  3. Test core workflows
  4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 3: Smoke Testing
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Tasks:**
  1. Add smoke tests for application startup
  2. Test basic user interactions
  3. Verify core features

### Phase 4: E2E Testing
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement complete story generation tests
  2. Add tests for complex interactions
  3. Test error recovery scenarios
