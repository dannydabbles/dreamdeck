- **Slash commands bypass the decision agent** and directly invoke the relevant tool or agent.
- `/storyboard` generates images for the **last Game Master message**.
- `/todo` saves reminders and notes in local markdown files under `./helper/YYYY-MM-DD/todo.md`.

## New Features

- **Smart Categorization of User Input:**
  - The app automatically classifies normal chat input into:
    - **Roll:** If the user wants to roll dice, the app will handle the roll before continuing the story.
    - **Search:** If the user wants to look up information, the app will perform a web search using SerpAPI.
    - **Continue Story:** If the user is continuing the story, the app will generate the next part of the narrative.
  - **Slash commands bypass this classification** and directly invoke the relevant tool.

## Overview

Dreamdeck is designed to:
- **Generate Immersive Narratives:** The AI Game Master (GM) creates detailed, character-driven stories that adapt to your choices and preferences.
- **Visualize Scenes:** Generate vivid storyboards to bring your narrative to life.
- **Store Everything Locally:** All your stories, characters, and elements are stored locally, ensuring your data is safe and accessible.
- **Support Multiple Languages:** Enjoy the app in multiple languages, including English, Bengali, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Dutch, Tamil, Telugu, and Chinese (Simplified).

## Getting Started

### Start a New Chat

1. **Open the App:**
   - When you first open the app, you'll see a welcome message from the Game Master. Choose the type of story you want to create.
   - The Game Master will guide you through the narrative, responding to your inputs and creating a dynamic, collaborative adventure.

### Interact with the GM

- **Describe Your Actions:** Type your actions or decisions in the chat box. The GM will respond with rich, detailed descriptions and narrative developments.
- **Explore Different Tones:** The GM can adapt to your preferred tone, whether it's lighthearted, serious, or intense. Just let the GM know how you want the story to feel.
- **Handle NPCs:** The GM will introduce and manage non-player characters (NPCs) with distinct personalities and motivations. Engage with them to uncover new story elements.
- **Avoid Speaking for the Player:** The GM will never assume your actions, thoughts, or emotions. You have full control over your character's decisions.

### Generate Storyboards

- **Visualize Scenes:** After the GM generates a narrative segment, the app will create storyboards to bring the scene to life.
- **View and Save Images:** The generated images will be displayed in the chat. You can save them for future reference or share them with others.
- You can also use `/storyboard` to generate images for the **last Game Master message** at any time.

### Use the Dice Roll Tool

- **Add an Element of Chance:** Use the `/roll` command to roll dice with natural language or dice notation.
- Dice rolls are also detected automatically in normal chat input.

### Manage TODOs

- Use `/todo` to save reminders and notes.
- TODO items are saved locally in markdown files under `./helper/YYYY-MM-DD/todo.md`.

### Knowledge Management

- **Location**: The knowledge directory MUST reside at the root of your project (`./knowledge`). 
- **Container Sync**: When running in Docker, ensure the `knowledge` folder is mounted or copied into the container.
- Files are **chunked and indexed** on startup or chat resume.
- The knowledge base is used for **retrieval-augmented generation** to enrich the story.

### Troubleshooting
If the system reports the knowledge directory is missing:
1. Confirm the `knowledge` folder exists in your project root.
2. Check Docker builds include the folder (see Dockerfile edits above).
3. Verify the path in `config.yaml` is set to `"knowledge"` (without leading slash).
4. Restart services after making changes.

### Example Usage

- **Rolling Dice:**
  - **User:** "I want to roll a 20-sided die."
  - **App:** ðŸŽ² You rolled a 15 on a 20-sided die.
  - **Or:** `/roll 1d20`

- **Web Search:**
  - **User:** "Search for the history of dragons in mythology."
  - **App:** Summarized search results.
  - **Or:** `/search history of dragons`

- **Continuing the Story:**
  - **User:** "I approach the old wizard in the tower."
  - **App:** The wizard looks up from his ancient tome, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. "Ah, a visitor! What brings you to my humble abode?"

### Local Storage

All your stories, characters, and elements are stored locally in a PostgreSQL database. This ensures that your data is safe and accessible, and you can resume your adventures at any time.
