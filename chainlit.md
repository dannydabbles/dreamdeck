# Dreamdeck: Your AI-Powered Storytelling Companion

Welcome to Dreamdeck! This application is your gateway to creating and managing immersive, collaborative stories with the help of AI. Whether you're a game master (GM) or a player, Dreamdeck will help you craft dynamic and engaging narratives, providing a Holodeck-like experience.

## Overview

Dreamdeck is designed to:
- **Generate Immersive Narratives:** The AI Game Master (GM) creates detailed, character-driven stories that adapt to your choices and preferences.
- **Visualize Scenes:** Generate vivid storyboards to bring your narrative to life.
- **Store Everything Locally:** All your stories, characters, and elements are stored locally, ensuring your data is safe and accessible.
- **Support Multiple Languages:** Enjoy the app in multiple languages, including English, Bengali, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Dutch, Tamil, Telugu, and Chinese (Simplified).

## Getting Started

### Start a New Chat

1. **Open the App:**
   - When you first open the app, you'll see a welcome message from the Game Master. Choose the type of story you want to create.
   - The Game Master will guide you through the narrative, responding to your inputs and creating a dynamic, collaborative adventure.

### Interact with the GM

- **Describe Your Actions:** Type your actions or decisions in the chat box. The GM will respond with rich, detailed descriptions and narrative developments.
- **Explore Different Tones:** The GM can adapt to your preferred tone, whether it's lighthearted, serious, or intense. Just let the GM know how you want the story to feel.
- **Handle NPCs:** The GM will introduce and manage non-player characters (NPCs) with distinct personalities and motivations. Engage with them to uncover new story elements.
- **Avoid Speaking for the Player:** The GM will never assume your actions, thoughts, or emotions. You have full control over your character's decisions.

### Generate Storyboards

- **Visualize Scenes:** After the GM generates a narrative segment, the app will create storyboards to bring the scene to life.
- **View and Save Images:** The generated images will be displayed in the chat. You can save them for future reference or share them with others.

### Use the Dice Roll Tool

- **Add an Element of Chance:** Use the `/roll` command to roll a dice with a specified number of sides (default is 100).

### Manage Knowledge

- **Enrich the Narrative:** The app can load and use knowledge documents to provide background information, lore, and additional context to your story.

### Example Scenarios

- **Setting a Scene:**
  - **GM:** The wooden floor creaks beneath your boots as you step into a dimly lit cabin. A single oil lamp illuminates frayed maps pinned to the walls, revealing an ominous coastline drawn in red ink.
  - **Player:** I examine the maps to see if I recognize any landmarks.
  - **GM:** They depict jagged cliffs and scattered islands. If you lean closer, you might notice faint notes scrawled along the margins, mentioning hidden passages. The question is: do you want to investigate the next location at night or rest until morning?

- **Multi-NPC Social Encounter:**
  - **GM:** In the bustling tavern, three notable patrons gather. A cloaked wanderer sips quietly by the fireplace, a traveling merchant waves a colorful scarf for sale, and the local bard strums a lute near the bar.
  - **Player:** I approach the wanderer. Maybe they’ve heard rumors about the artifact I seek.
  - **GM:** Wanderer (voice quiet): “Depends who’s asking. The roads are dangerous for those chasing old legends.”  
  - **Merchant (calling out):** “Ah, but coin can buy safety, friend! Care for a scarf or two?”  
  - **Bard (hums a tune):** “Or you can pay me to compose a mighty ballad of your quest.”

- **Dramatic Combat:**
  - **GM:** Two armed bandits block the forest trail ahead, each brandishing a crude blade. One yells, “Hand over your valuables!”
  - **Player:** I step back, draw my bow, and warn them to leave me alone.
  - **GM:** The lead bandit smirks. “Got some nerve, do you?” He signals the other to flank your left. [OOC: Roll for initiative or declare another action. If you want to intimidate them, we can resolve that too.]

- **Puzzle or Riddle:**
  - **GM:** Deep in the catacombs, a sealed gate bears a riddle etched in marble: “When day merges with night, truth awakens in the silver light.” A circular depression suggests a missing object or key.
  - **Player:** I investigate the altar nearby for anything that might fit that depression.
  - **GM:** The altar holds a sun-and-moon motif carved in stone. If you’d like to attempt a lore check or solve the riddle directly, feel free.
